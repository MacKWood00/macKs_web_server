        <p>
            I am a hardworking individual who is always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. 
            In the next few years, I aim to further develop my skills in cybersecurity, tackle complex challenges, 
            and continue expanding my knowledge to make a significant impact in the field. My goal after graduation
            is to work at the information technology center for the city of Augusta. Once I'm able to get my foot in the door,
            I want to branch out and work for a military base which is a big Cyber center for the city of Augusta. Once that is done,
            I want to branch out and learn the most I can about the field I'm working in. I plan to get plenty of certifications as 
            well as more career development in the next five years.
